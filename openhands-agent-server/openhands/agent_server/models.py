    with ``?include_skills=true``.

    The trim exists because when an ``AgentContext`` is constructed

    model_validator resolves the entire skill catalog (~40 entries in
    stock setups) and persists them inline. Every conversation fetch

    app-server, SDK examples all ignore the field on
    ``ConversationInfo`` — they either use the in-process
    ``LocalConversation`` directly or read other fields like
    ``agent.llm.model``).

    The persisted ``ConversationState`` on disk and the in-memory copy
    held by the agent's runtime are untouched.

    A ``model_copy`` chain is enough because ``BaseModel.model_copy``
    is shallow on default — we replace the leaf ``skills`` list with
    an empty list without touching any other field. The returned
